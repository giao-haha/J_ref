 One of the primary difficulties that I have faced this time was with the copy constructor and assignment operator to ensure deep copying of dynamically allocated memory, preventing issues like double deletion and dangling pointers. But after this assigment I understanding better what is the rule of three. Additionally, file I/O operations using ifstream and ofstream to read from and write to files, gave a practical skill for handling persistent data storage and retrieval. Other operator overloading like +=, <<, and >> is getting easier too, particularly with the use of iostream. Overloading the stream insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators enhances the usability of the class by allowing easy input and output operations. The code also emphasizes encapsulation and data hiding, with the Numbers class encapsulating its data members and providing public methods to interact with them, ensuring that the internal state of the object is protected and can only be modified through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation is a core principle of OOP that promotes modularity and maintainability. Furthermore, the display method gave me a lot of headache, since there was a lot of element to print in specific orders, and to put all of that together with validations took a lot of time.
